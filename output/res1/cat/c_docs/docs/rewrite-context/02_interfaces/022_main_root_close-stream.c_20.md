# Interface Facts: main_root_close-stream.c_20

This document is intended for the later Rust repository-level rewrite and keeps only the interface facts directly observed in the current source-analysis stage.
Header files, macros, error codes, and configuration items that do not appear in the current parse results will not be added or assumed.

## Global Variables
- No global variable definitions were observed in the current module's `.c` files.

## Known Gaps
- This document is generated from parsed results for functions, structs, macros, and global variables; it does not infer declaration signatures from `.h` files that were not parsed.
- If a function appears in the "Functions" section without an explicit header binding, the later Rust migration should re-check the corresponding source `#include` relationships and build scripts.
- Error codes, configuration items, and input/output protocols are recorded only when explicit symbols appear in the source; missing entries do not mean the semantics do not exist, only that the current fact extraction did not observe them.
